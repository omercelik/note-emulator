# Profile harness reproduction

Start with `tools/browser-benchmark/` at source revision
`74b87d24ec5c45b5953087b338af33d90c23b26a`, then apply
[harness.patch](harness.patch) from that checkout root with `git apply`.
The patch preserves the two modified capture files; the other 26 files matched
that revision exactly. See the [evidence retention policy](../README.md) for future captures.

For the historical `capture.mjs` layout, copy the patched
`tools/browser-benchmark/` directory to `harness/` beneath the local capture root.
The archived script contains the original path labels; adjust its `root`, `tree`
and firmware paths for the local checkout before reproducing the capture.
