# Measurement record: September 19, experiments 1–13

## Setup

- Main/source baseline d5446b4a; origin fetched and matches.
- Experimental checkout `work/night`, branch `night/speed-0919`.
- Catalog checkout `work/night-catalog`, branch `codex/experiment-catalog`.
- Inputs `work/night-run/assets.json`; hashes match EX042 published receipt.
- Baseline release artifact `work/night-run/wasm/base.wasm`; cpu-profile sibling `base-cpuprof.wasm`.
- Board enumerates `/dev/cu.usbmodem101`.

## Completed: baseline A/A

Receipt `work/night-run/aa-0/summary.json`: 87.934745 / 86.865130 wall seconds. Both advance 47.750049575 guest seconds and execute 9,819,885,134 instructions. Both pass the battery with identical console SHA-256 f4e7e4f3be2f988b8b52d2797d373208b49e86e70b9c2b6618910a90c7e36291. Same-artifact spread is about 1.2%; do not promote small screening differences as wins.

## Step 2: profile, counters, EX109 screens

- Fresh CPU profile of d5446b4a (`prof-base-retry/cpu-summary.txt`, diagnostic build, 102 s sampled): generated blocks 36.8%, `run_block_inner` 19.6%, `jit::run` wrapper 12.3%, machine run 4.9%, `step_blocks` 4.9%, `exec_insn` 3.5%, `flush_ticks` 2.3%, `ready` 1.5%. Roughly 45% of host time is per-dispatch overhead, not guest work.
- jit-profile counters (`jitprof-base/events.json`, 118 s instrumented run): about 741M dispatches (629M compiled at 14.3 insns each, 112M interpreted at 2.1). Core-0 regions: 320M calls retire 6.21G instructions (19.4 per call), 99.9% exit by leaving the region.
- Inference (not yet measured): with 19-instruction region calls against a 64-instruction quantum, about 30% of region calls meet a quantum cut, and each cut costs extra dispatches (partial block module, then the resumed checked path, which cannot enter a region because `entry != 0`).
- EX109 guarded RETW (peer, commit c831cf69, 43,643 differential cases pass): one pair 89.43 → 87.72 s, 1.9% less, equal work and console. EX109 + singleton RETW admission (a29cad87, 44,155 cases): 86.46 → 87.53 s, 1.2% more. Base-to-base spread tonight is 86.5–89.4 s, so both are inside noise. Status: weak / inconclusive. Receipts `runs/ex109-s1`, `runs/ex109single-s1`.
- Peer now porting EX038 + EX065 (+ EX106 direct resume offset) as a "dispatch diet" branch.
- Coordinator starting EX133 "virtual quanta": multi-quantum core-0 budget while core 1 is idle, bit-exact by construction (bounded by next device deadline, any peripheral access aborts before the instruction and falls back to the legacy quantum). Differs from EX047 (q1024), which changed the instruction total.

## Step 3: first real wins

### Dispatch diet (peer; EX038 + EX065 + EX106), plain main base
- diet1 = EX038 boxed cache + EX065 negative region-coverage cache, commit 174ac1ee: 82.77 → 78.42 s (−5.3%), one pair.
- diet2 = diet1 + EX106 direct CUT resume index, commit 4b508e83: 86.55 → 77.36 s (−10.6%), one pair. Equal instructions and console hash in all arms. 42,107 differential cases pass. Receipts `runs/diet2-s1`, `runs/diet1-s1`. Needs 3-pair confirmation.
- diet3 (7409dc76: lazy resume lookup, shared helper table, cold-split ready) and EX121 wasm-opt artifacts are built, unscreened.

### EX133 virtual quanta (coordinator; new idea, commit 2f… on night/speed-0919)
While every other core idles, core 0 runs up to K scheduling quanta in one budget. K is bounded so that no device flush, script event, page push, peer timer wake-up, cycle limit or instruction limit falls due at an interior boundary. A device-register word access stops in front of its instruction (bus `defer_access`), the spanned rounds are closed exactly as the loop would have closed them, and the current quantum finishes the old way. 64-instruction semantics are preserved bit for bit; only the needless cuts go away.
- Untimed correctness runs, all with 9,819,885,134 instructions, 47.750049575 guest s, 36 checks, console f4e7e4f3be2f988b:
  - K≤4 (MAX_TICK_DEFER 256 untouched): 76.3 s wall (peer was compiling during the run).
  - K≤64 with MAX_TICK_DEFER 4096 (EX134): 56.2 s wall → 0.85×.
  - K≤1000 with MAX_TICK_DEFER 65536: 54.2 s wall → 0.88×.
- EX134 caveat: the 256-cycle fallback exists for devices without an explicit deadline (I2S/LCD_CAM/camera DMA steppers, WiFi air). TinyDraw output is unchanged, but EX005 shows cadence changes can alter the Atech WAV. Needs an "only when no cadence-driven device is active" rule before it can be proposed upstream.

## Step 4: timed screens of EX133/EX134

| Arm (one pair each, vs d5446b4a base in the same pair) | base s | cand s | change | realtime |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| EX133 K≤4, tick deferral untouched (`runs/vq4-s1`) | 85.26 | 70.47 | −17.3% | 0.68× |
| EX133 K≤1000 + EX134 MAX_TICK_DEFER 65536 (`runs/vq1000-s1`) | 82.18 | 53.89 | −34.4% | 0.886× |

All arms: 9,819,885,134 instructions, console f4e7e4f3…, 36/36. A STRICT build (panics on any device-register access that escaped deferral) completed the whole battery: no PIE/MAC16 path reaches a register in this workload (`check-vq1000-strict`).

Review findings from the peer, all accepted:
- PIE/MAC16 word accesses are not decoded by `word_access`; bus-level backstop counts them (`vq_violations`), and L32r was added. Production claim must stay "exact unless the counter is non-zero".
- C3/C6 buses do not honour deferral: `SocBus::can_defer` gates EX133 to the S3 (commit 4e5b4519).
- EX134 as a constant is NOT generally safe. RMT, RTC watchdog and USB-Serial/JTAG SOF have no reported deadline; USB's accumulator subtracts one 60000-cycle period per tick, so a 65536-cycle batch would drift. TinyDraw equality does not prove other firmware. Peer is implementing EX134-safe: 256-cycle cap whenever any cadence-driven device is active, otherwise 32768.

## Step 5: combined stack: 0.92–0.95× realtime, bit-exact

Branch `night/combined-0919` (peer's worktree `work/night-combined`) = EX133 + EX134 knobs + dispatch diet (EX038, EX065, EX106, diet3).

| Arm (one pair each) | base s | cand s | change | realtime |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| combined, K≤1000, MAX_TICK_DEFER 65536 constant (unsafe in general) | 84.26 | 50.32 | −40.3% | 0.949× |
| same + wasm-opt -O3 (EX121) | 83.66 | 49.87 | −40.4% | 0.957× |
| combined-safe, K≤4, deferral untouched | 83.44 | 65.49 | −21.5% | 0.729× |
| **combined-quiet** 5863a82d: K≤1000, EX134-safe (256 cap while any cadence-driven device is active, else 32768) | 82.68 | 51.71 | −37.5% | **0.923×** |

Every arm: 9,819,885,134 instructions, console f4e7e4f3…, 36/36, zero JIT failures. EX121 wasm-opt: about 1%, inside noise → not worth build plumbing.

EX133 round counters (`stats-vq1000`, diagnostic build): 1.67M multi-quantum runs cover 134.3M quanta (80 quanta ≈ 5,100 instructions per run); 1.48M runs end at a device-register access, 11K at waiti; 8.1M rounds have both cores busy and 1.5M only core 1 (legacy path). So 93% of busy quanta now run uncut. Core-0 dispatches fell from ~741M to ~437M; region calls now retire 32 instructions each (was 19).

Core 1's 613M instructions are FreeRTOS critical-section / spinlock code (`spinlock_acquire`, `vPortExitCritical`, ROM `_xtos_set_intlevel`), 3.5 instructions per dispatch. Both-busy rounds must keep the 64-instruction interleave (shared-memory compare-and-set), so they stay on the old path.

## Step 6: EX135, safety fixes, second workload

- **EX135 fewer forced block boundaries around special registers** (coordinator, commit 5942cd06 on `night/ex135-sr-blocks`; peer's integrated version f5fdd86a + loop-state fix): RSYNC/ESYNC/DSYNC no longer end a block and emit as no-ops; RSR/WSR of PS and INTENABLE no longer force a block start; the wasm backend emits RSR for registers whose `Cpu` field is exact mid-dispatch (PS, PRID, EXCSAVE, EPC, …); WSR/XSR/RSIL are terminal helpers. Motivation: core 1 is 28% of all dispatches for 6% of instructions, nearly all FreeRTOS critical sections from the touch sampler's I2C polling (`_xtos_set_intlevel` took 5 dispatches for 9 instructions). Bit-exact on the battery; compiled share 95.3% → 97.7%; one pair on top of EX133/134: 53.34 → 52.08 s (−2.4%, weak). Peer review found and fixed one real bug before the combined2 validation: a terminal WSR/XSR of LBEG/LEND/LCOUNT after a retained hardware-loop prefix breaks the retired-offset reconstruction. Such writes still compile; their blocks can no longer retain a loop prefix. 919 new directed cases, 43,257 total pass.
- **PIE/MAC16 deferral hole closed** (peer, 8e49f2f0): when armed, a PIE or MAC16 load form scans the 16 visible address registers against the device range (±128 bytes slack for `ld.qr/st.qr`), so no operand decoding; 231 new cases.
- **EX134 unsafe constant is wrong on pocket-tank, EX134-safe is right.** `runs/pt-ex135` (K≤1000, MAX_TICK_DEFER 65536 constant): 10,073,833,712 instructions instead of the pinned 10,073,833,775 → rejected by the harness. `runs/pt-combined2` (cadence guard, quiet cap 32768): exact total and console 9e8a66e4, 83.59 → 78.49 s (−6.1%). pocket-tank keeps both cores busy, so EX133 rarely applies there; the gain is the dispatch diet.
- Native check: `--no-jit` pocket-tank for 30 guest seconds gives identical pc/ccount/insns with ESP32SIM_VQ=1 and =1000 (K≤4 natively).

## Step 7: confirmation, new profile, past 1.0×

**combined2 (2f8093d8) confirmed with three alternating pairs** (`runs/combined2-x3`): base 83.95 / 84.92 / 83.18 s, candidate 49.75 / 50.20 / 51.07 s → median 83.95 → 50.20 s, **−40.2%, 0.951× modeled realtime**, every run 9,819,885,134 instructions, console f4e7e4f3…, 36/36.

Profile of combined2 (`prof-combined2`, 54 s sampled): generated blocks 37.1%, `jit::run` wrapper 15.2%, `run_block_inner` 14.4%, other 17.7%, `step_blocks` 6.0%, machine run 4.4%, `exec_insn` 3.7%. Counters (`stats-ex136`): 560M dispatches (core 0: 355M compiled at 26.5 instructions + 74M interpreted; core 1: 96M + 35M); 254M core-0 region calls retire 7.96G instructions, 98% of exits "left".

On top of combined2, branch `night/fast-entry-0919` (`work/night-fast`), one pair each, all bit-exact:

| Step | base s | cand s | change | realtime |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| EX136 region-entry facts cached in the dispatched block (epoch-validated; no walk through owner block → region → 3 vectors) vs combined2 | 49.65 | 48.33 | −2.7% | 0.99× |
| EX137 region limits 8 chunks/64 insns/4 pages → 24/192/6, vs EX136 | 48.23 | 42.92 | −11.0% | **1.11×** |
| EX137b limits → 64/512/8, vs EX137 | 43.93 | 41.89 | −4.6% | **1.14×** |

EX137 is the widening part of EX043 retried in isolation under a materially different condition (virtual quanta). EX043 was a flat multi-change bundle, so its null result cannot be attributed to the quantum alone. Cumulative generated wasm grows 98 → 111 MB.

EX136 gave 2.7% in this screen, not the 10–15% I had guessed for the `jit::run` wrapper; it does not isolate every wrapper cost.

## Step 8: robustness of the fast-entry head (eaf23abc)

- `cargo test --release --workspace` on `night/fast-entry-0919`: every suite passes (goldens included), 0 failed.
- Production page (`resp-ex137b`, real worker + pacing, headless Chrome): boots the battery firmware to `READY` in 54.7 s wall (the 2026-09-05 receipt needed 120.5 s), replays 3 strokes, 3 commits, 24/24 movement points answered; movement → canvas median 37.6 ms, max 52.4 ms (2026-09-05: 44.8 ms median with one 492 ms outlier). Screenshot shows three correct strokes and the minimap.

## Step 9: the timed model on the fast head: 0.48× → 0.93×

Merged `codex/fast-integration` (EX066's approximate-timing stack: frontier scheduler, data-cache model 160/96 with contention, timed SPI2 completion, measured TE) into the fast head → branch `night/timed-0919` (`work/night-timed`, 16 conflict hunks, virtual quanta disabled in approximate mode). Same experiment exports as EX066's final run (`esp32sim_set_approximate_jit_timing 1 64`, frontiers, cache 160/96/2, contention, SPI2 timing, measured TE), supplied through a `tinydraw-timed` workload entry.

**EX139 solo batches in the frontier scheduler:** when every other core idles, the running core's batch may extend to the next device/script deadline instead of 64 instructions; the first dispatch of a batch runs undeferred (a register it reaches sees batch-start time, as any access did in the 64-instruction batches this replaces), later dispatches stop in front of a device register and yield, so those accesses happen at settled device time.

| Timed configuration (untimed single runs, all 36 checks pass, zero JIT failures) | guest s | wall s | realtime |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| EX066 as archived (d13b7f93, 2026-09-07) | 60.158 | 125.79 | 0.478× |
| fast head, solo batching off (`check-timed-nosolo`) | 60.008 | 95.74 | 0.627× |
| fast head + EX139 (`check-timed-solo`) | 60.025 | 64.54 | **0.930×** |

Model fidelity is unchanged from EX066 (hardware needs 78.70 s for this battery per EX078, with the stored-drawing state caveat); what changed is that the timed configuration now costs about realtime instead of 2×. Instruction totals differ slightly between the three (10,039,507,230 / 10,038,971,428 / 10,045,820,831) because batch boundaries feed the penalty model; no exactness claim is made for approximate mode.

## Step 10: confirmations, exit histogram, matched hardware reference

**combined3 (75382bcc = combined2 + EX136 + EX137/137b) confirmed with three alternating pairs** (`runs/combined3-x3`): base 83.22 / 83.02 / 83.25 s, candidate 42.59 / 42.56 / 42.68 s → **−48.8%, 1.12× modeled realtime**, bit-exact in all six runs. Peer: 43,257 differential cases, native suites and CI clippy pass on the same commit.

pocket-tank on combined3 (`runs/pt-combined3`): exact (10,073,833,775, console 9e8a66e4), 80.99 → 68.84 s (−15.0%), i.e. 0.37× → 0.44× realtime. Both cores stay busy there, so EX133 cannot apply; this workload still needs raw throughput (PIE kernels) — it is the honest counter-example to "we are at realtime".

Region exit histogram (peer's jit-profile counters, `stats-combined3`), core 0: 133.8M region calls retire 8.38G instructions (62.6 per call). Exits by kind: RETW 51.7M, CALL 45.6M, CALLX 8.2M, outside edge 8.6M, slow memory 8.3M, budget 6.2M. Calls + returns are 82% of exits, but at ~38 ns per dispatch that is about 4 s of 42 s: a bounded (<10%) lever that needs windowed call/return emission inside regions. Parked.

**Hardware reference with matched start state (EX078 retry; board erased as authorized).** `esptool erase-flash`, frozen bootloader/ptable/app written and verified, captured with `tools/fast-hardware/capture-gate.py` twice from an erased chip: 36/36 gates, `TINYDRAW_AUTOSAVE_RESTORE generation=0` (the emulator's erased start; EX078 had restored 38 operations), startup-serial → verdict **77.392 s and 77.400 s**. Files `hw/erased-boot-{1,2}.*`, `hw/erased-summary-{1,2}.json`.

Firmware-timer ratios, emulator ÷ hardware (`bin/cmp-hw.py`, medians over the 15 paced cold tests unless noted):

| | compute_us | present_us | wall_us | HARD total_us (4) | load_us | export | ring PIE / scalar |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| untimed fast head | 0.726 | 0.284 | 0.562 | 0.519 | 0.430 | 0.553 | 0.153 / 0.694 |
| timed model (EX066 config + EX139) | 0.749 | 0.900 | 0.787 | 0.820 | 0.472 | 0.784 | 1.015 / 1.165 |

Whole battery: hardware 77.4 s; timed model 60.0 guest s (0.78); untimed 47.75 guest s (0.62, an effective hardware CPI of 1.62 against the instruction clock). The ratios equal EX056's (0.749 / 0.899), so the stored-drawing mismatch was not what held them down. Largest remaining gaps: document load (0.47, FP-heavy → EX057 dependency latency) and compute (0.75).

## Step 11 EX043 mapping component: no gain. EX138 control-flow prices: accuracy 0.75 → 0.94 at 0.99× realtime

- **EX043 last-mapping TLB reuse, isolated** (peer, d6daa2cb on `night/mapping-cache-0919`, 43,621 cases pass): two pairs vs combined3, base 43.02 / 42.76 s, candidate 44.89 / 44.49 s → **4.2% slower**, exact work. Parked again, now with an isolated result under long virtual-quantum runs.
- **EX138 measured control-flow prices on the timed model** (`night/timed-0919`): on top of the EX066 configuration + EX139, every taken branch costs 3 cycles, J 3, JX 6, LOOP setup 5, QUO 4, REM 5 (EX068 ladders); CALLn priced as J, CALLXn/RET/RETW as JX and ENTRY as 3, which reproduces the measured 16-cycle `callx8/entry/add/retw.n` level but is not individually measured. Emitted at code-generation time as one add to `Cpu::timing_extra` on the taken path only; the interpreter and the helper charge the same table; the frontier scheduler spends the extras from the batch budget without ending the batch.

| Firmware timer ÷ hardware (erased-start board, boot 1) | timed (EX066 cfg + EX139) | + EX138 prices |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| paced cold compute_us (median of 15) | 0.749 | **0.938** |
| paced cold present_us | 0.900 | 0.989 |
| paced cold wall_us | 0.787 | 0.947 |
| HARD total_us (4) | 0.820 | 0.938 |
| export elapsed_us | 0.784 | 0.911 |
| document load_us | 0.472 | 0.602 |
| panel staging linear PIE / scalar | 0.839 / 0.989 | 0.961 / 1.002 |
| panel staging ring PIE / scalar | 1.015 / 1.165 | 1.048 / 1.222 |
| whole battery guest seconds (hardware 77.4 s) | 60.0 (0.78) | **69.0 (0.89)** |
| host wall seconds → realtime | 64.5 → 0.93× | **69.9 → 0.987×** |

All 36 checks pass, zero JIT failures (`check-timed-priced`, full table `cmp-hw-priced.txt`). This is the thesis from the start of the night, now measured: pricing cycles moves the model toward the silicon *and* keeps realtime, because more cycles per instruction means less guest work per simulated second. (A higher guest-seconds-per-wall-second ratio under a different clock is not an equal-work host speedup; the exact-clock rows are the equal-work comparison.) Still open: load-use (+1, measured in EX067), FP dependency latency (EX057; explains the 0.60 document load), ring-scalar overshoot from the provisional cache parameters, L32R and instruction-fetch cache.

### EX138 load-use and EX140 static FP result readiness: timers within ~0.5% of the board (medians)

- Load-use (+1 cycle when an instruction reads the result of the load right before it; EX067) → compute 0.960, wall 0.961, HARD 0.960, export 0.972 (`check-timed-priced-lu`).
- **EX140 static FP readiness**: ADD.S/MUL.S/MADD.S results usable four cycles after a one-cycle issue, consumers stall (EX079, measured; SUB.S/MSUB.S assumed equal; all other FP writers one cycle). Computed once per decoded straight-line run together with load-use (`exec::static_extras`), so the emitter folds it into constants and the interpreter reads a byte per instruction. Dependencies across a block boundary are not charged.

| Firmware timer ÷ hardware (erased-start board, boot 1; boot 2 agrees to 3 decimals) | EX066 cfg + EX139 | + EX138 control | + load-use | + EX140 FP |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| paced cold compute_us, median of 15 | 0.749 | 0.938 | 0.960 | **0.998** (min 0.937, max 1.013) |
| paced cold present_us | 0.900 | 0.989 | 1.007 | 0.996 (0.934–1.047) |
| paced cold wall_us | 0.787 | 0.947 | 0.961 | **0.995** (0.958–1.016) |
| HARD total_us (4) | 0.820 | 0.938 | 0.960 | 0.995 (0.962–1.016) |
| export elapsed_us | 0.784 | 0.911 | 0.972 | 0.975 |
| document load_us | 0.472 | 0.602 | 0.618 | 0.651 |
| ring PIE / ring scalar staging | 1.015 / 1.165 | 1.048 / 1.222 | 1.057 / 1.223 | 1.057 / 1.223 |
| whole battery guest s (hardware 77.4) | 60.0 | 69.0 | 70.4 | 72.3 (0.934) |
| host wall s → realtime | 64.5 → 0.93× | 69.9 → 0.99× | 71.7 → 0.98× | 74.9 → 0.97× (peer profiling concurrently) |

36/36 checks pass in every configuration. Known misfits, each with a named cause candidate: document load 0.65 (FP divide/sqrt sequences and conversions are unpriced; dependencies across loop backedges are not charged), ring-scalar staging 1.22 (provisional 160/96-cycle data-cache parameters from EX054), whole battery 0.93 (boot, flash/instruction-cache fetch EX055, L32R, call/return prices derived not measured). This is a fit to one firmware on one board revision; the prices are the measured ones, not tuned to this table.

### EX141: EX081's captured control cells finally analysed → measured call/return prices and a fetch-alignment cycle

EX081 ("captured / not fully analyzed") holds nine control cells, two boots, 9 samples each, identical medians in both boots (`fast-control-2026-09-07/boot-{1,2}.log`, disassembly alongside). Per bundle, against the matching straight-line control:

| Cell | extra cycles per bundle | reading |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `nop256` − `empty` | 1.0000 | one cycle per instruction |
| `beqz` not taken | 0.0000 | not-taken branch costs its own cycle only |
| `beqz` taken over one instruction (9-byte stride) | **2.5000** | taken branch = 3 cycles, **plus one cycle whenever the target instruction straddles a 32-bit fetch word**: with a 9-byte stride the targets sweep all four alignments and a 3-byte instruction straddles at 2 and 3 mod 4 → +0.5 on average. The zero-overhead-loop ladder (core-timing README: +1 only at body start 3 mod 4 with 2-byte instructions) is the same rule, `(pc & 3) + length > 4`. |
| `call0` + `ret` | 4.5031 | call 3, return 3 (not 6 like JX), +0.5 alignment on the return address |
| `call8` + `entry` + `retw` | 4.5029 | same, ENTRY costs its own cycle only |

So my first EX138 call/return prices (call 3, ENTRY 3, return 6, derived from the 16-cycle `callx8` level) overcharged every call by about 4.5 cycles, and the near-perfect 0.998 compute fit was partly that error cancelling the missing alignment cycle. With the measured values (call 3, return 3, ENTRY 1, CALLX still assumed = JX 6, alignment cycle on every redirected fetch whose target straddles):

| Firmware timer ÷ hardware | EX140 (derived call prices) | EX141 (measured) |
| --- | ---: | ---: |

| paced cold present_us | 0.996 | 1.022 (0.968–1.065) |

| host wall s → realtime | 74.9 → 0.97× | 71.9 → **1.003×** |

The measured table is the one to keep: the compute median is 0.964 with cases from 0.910 to 0.973, instead of a median that was right partly by cancellation. Unpriced and plausible for the remainder: window overflow/underflow exception entry (35 cycles per spilled frame measured, the emulator only charges the handler's instructions), interrupt entry/resume (228/142 cycles measured), L32R, instruction-fetch cache misses (EX055), CALLX.

## Step 12: the timed model on a second firmware, and the both-busy quantum in approximate mode (EX143)

Peer review of the pricing commits found five real defects (double charge on divide fallbacks, +6 on skipped LOOPNEZ/LOOPGTZ bodies, priced hardware-loop backedges in the interpreter only, FP readiness not cleared by fast overwrites, timeline not aged by fixed opcode costs). All fixed in 3af6fd22; battery ratios unchanged (rare paths).

**pocket-tank under the timed + priced model** (`check-pt-timed*`, same exports as TinyDraw): the firmware reports **9.5 tok/s and 34–35 fps**; `docs/speed-plan.md` gives the real board as 12 tok/s and 25–30 fps; the instruction clock gives 24.3 tok/s and 62.5 fps. So the prices transfer to a firmware they were never fitted on: inference is now 20% slow (flash weight loads through the provisional 160-cycle cache fill) and rendering 25% fast (display path), instead of both being 2× fast. The harness's `model_decisions ≥ 10` check fails at this speed, as it must.

**EX143 both-busy quantum in approximate mode.** The frontier scheduler interleaves two busy cores every 64 instructions. In approximate mode there is no bit-exactness contract, only the fit to hardware, so the quantum is a free parameter (the EX066 API already allowed up to 4096). Single untimed runs:

| | quantum 64 | quantum 512 | quantum 4096 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| pocket-tank realtime (tok/s, fps unchanged at 9.5 / 35) | 0.47× | 0.61× | 0.61× |
| TinyDraw realtime | 0.98× | **1.11×** | — |
| TinyDraw compute / wall / HARD ratio to hardware | 0.964 / 0.978 / 0.985 | 0.963 / 0.978 / 0.985 | — |

36/36 in both TinyDraw runs. This is EX047's knob, acceptable here only because the mode is approximate and the hardware-timer fit did not move; it must not leak into the exact path.

## Step 13: EX136 hot-loop pair (no gain); the production page under the hardware-timing model, and a real bug it exposed

- **EX136 extension, cached admitted loop pair** (peer, 6b844713, 43,263 cases): pocket-tank 69.68 → 70.89 s, TinyDraw 43.00 → 43.10 s against combined3. No gain; not adopted.
- **`?timing=hw` on the page** (`night/timed-0919`): `web/wasm/worker.js` applies the timing-model exports after the loads and before boot; `web/emu.js` and the response harness pass them for `timing=hw` (the harness also takes `timing=hw-<n>-<m>` to drop exports when bisecting). Needs a wasm built with `--features cache-inline`.
- First run: the page booted the battery in 79.7 s wall (the board needs 77.4 s plus boot) but **no stroke registered**. Bisecting the exports found `esp32sim_set_measured_te`: it swaps in a new board before boot and re-attaches its I2C devices, and `I2c::attach` appended, so the old board's touch controller kept answering while input went to the new one. The battery never touches the screen, so EX056/EX066 could not see it. Fix: attach replaces a device at an occupied address.
- After the fix (`resp-timed-hw-r3`): boot to READY 80.1 s wall, 3/3 strokes committed, 24/24 movement points, movement → canvas median 38.3 ms (max 49.3), screenshot correct. So the page now keeps device time through the whole battery and stays interactive.
