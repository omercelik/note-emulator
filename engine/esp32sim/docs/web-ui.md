# Web UI and protocol

`web/index.html` is the site's landing page (what GitHub Pages shows at the root: the demos,
the coding-agent story, the chip facts); every demo opens `web/run.html`, the emulator page.
`run.html` lays itself out as a workbench (`workbench.js`, `workbench.css`: the device on a stage,
the console under it, a rail with hints, telemetry, the machine's configuration and the same
run as a CLI command); `?plain` gives the bare page. Both pages follow the system's light or dark theme; the ☾/☀
button in the header picks one and remembers it in the browser (`localStorage`). The console is
dark in both. `index.html?wasm&fw=…` links from before the split redirect to `run.html`.

`--web PORT` serves `web/run.html` (no build step, no dependencies) and a WebSocket on the
same port. The page shows the board (Atech: 14-port drawing with knob, ring, buttons,
speaker VU, the TFT in its physical orientation plus a readable copy; Waveshare: camera
panel with picture upload / webcam and speaker meter; bare: console only), the USB-CDC and
UART0 consoles, an action box for the SDK's JSON protocol, and audio through WebAudio
(click 🔇 once — browsers require a user gesture).

The native server accepts browser WebSocket connections only from pages at
`http://127.0.0.1:PORT` or `http://localhost:PORT`, using the server's port. It checks
the browser's `Origin` header, which identifies the page's scheme, host and port.
Local native clients may omit `Origin`; the server treats those tools as trusted.
See the [Origin check](../esp-soc/src/web.rs) for the implementation.

The header shows emulated time, instructions, frames, and `real time` / `⚠ N% of real time` /
resync count. The percentage is emulated seconds per wall second over the last second: a
resynchronisation resets the lag but not this, so a run that cannot keep up stays visible. The audio buffer is adaptive: it starts at 60 ms and grows on underrun (up to
400 ms) so a busy firmware phase (a full display redraw) does not produce gaps.

## Emulator → browser

Text frames (JSON):

| `t` | Fields | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `board` | `name` | on connect; the page switches layout |
| `serial` | `src` (`usb`/`uart0`), `data` | console output (ANSI colours stripped by the page) |
| `ring` | `leds` `[[r,g,b]…]` | ring changed |
| `stat` | `time`, `insns`, `frames`, `behind`, `resyncs`, `speed` (emulated seconds per wall second over the last second, `null` before the first second and when not paced), `cam`, `gpio_in` | every 20 ms emulated |

Binary frames (first byte = type):

| Type | Payload |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | TFT frame: `w u16le, h u16le`, RGB565 pixels (160×80) — quiet-push boards defer at most one push interval; other boards send when changed |
| — | `{"t":"emu","msg":…}` — a line from the emulator itself (wasm build: stubs, chip resets, load errors), shown in the console |
| 2 | audio: `[rate u32 le]` then int16le mono samples; the rate is what the firmware programmed the I2S clock to (44.1 kHz Atech, 24 kHz autopling, 22.05 kHz the panel's SID player) and can change between chunks |
| 4 | camera preview: `w u16le, h u16le`, RGB888 (320×240) |

On quiet-push boards, continuous redraws are published on every other push opportunity rather
than waiting indefinitely for silence. This keeps drawing visible but can expose a partially
updated frame. It is a publication policy, not a model of physical panel scanout.

A late-joining tab gets a snapshot (console backlog, last frame, ring, preview) on connect.

## Browser → emulator

Text frames:

| `t` | Fields |
| --- | --- |
| `btn` | `pin`, `v` (1 = pressed) |
| `knobpress` | `v` |
| `reset` | none: the board's reset button. The page's Restart sends it to a native run; in the browser build Restart reloads the page, which is the same thing there. Honoured when the run can come back up: through the ROM, or for `--boot app` by entering the app again; ignored with `--no-reboot` |
| `knob` | `d` (+1 cw / −1 ccw per detent); the emulator queues the quadrature edges 2 ms apart |
| `serial` | `line`, optional `src` (`usb` default, `uart0`, `uart1`) — the line plus a newline into that console's RX |
| `key` | `src`, `data` — bytes exactly as typed, no newline added: the page's console is a terminal (click it, type; Enter is CR, Backspace DEL, arrows and Ctrl-letters their escape/control codes, paste sends the text). The **Terminal** tab (`web/terminal.js`) is a real VT100 on UART0 — xterm.js (MIT; `tools/fetch-web-vendor.sh` puts it in `web/vendor/xterm`, pinned by hash — not committed), 100×30 — so cursor movement, colours and full-screen programs render; it encodes its own keys into the same `key` message |
| `gpio` | `pin`, `level` |
| `touch` | `x`, `y`, `down` (1 = touching); panel coordinates — a rotated panel view (the panel header's selector, `?rotate=`, or a manifest's `display_rotate`) maps its point back first |

Binary frame type 3: camera picture, `w u16le, h u16le`, RGBA8888 — used by the picture
upload and the webcam (4 fps). Frames up to 8 MB are accepted.

## Sending is never blocking

Each client has a writer thread with a bounded queue; when a tab is frozen or slow, frames
are dropped for that client and the emulator keeps running at real time.
