//! Real silicon seeds it from radio noise. Here it is an xorshift32 generator whose every read
//! also folds in the CPU cycle count the chip reports through `now`, which is enough for the
//! bootloader's stack canary and for `esp_random` to make progress. The C3 mounts it at
//! APB_CTRL + 0xB0 and the C6 at LPPERI + 0x8; where it sits is the chip's table's business.
//! The S3 keeps its own xorshift64 register inside its SYSTEM-clone block: same job, different
//! sequence.
